<p>This keyboard app lets you input Chinese characters by typing stroke sequences (e.g. 天 is ㇐㇐㇒㇔).</p>
<p>It is a minimalist implementation with the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Good character support (over 28k characters) including vernacular Cantonese</li>
  <li>User preference for traditional or simplified characters</li>
  <li>No ads</li>
  <li>No permissions</li>
  <li>No tracking or telemetry</li>
  <li>Deterministic candidate generation which doesn't learn user input</li>
</ul>
<p>After installing the app, launch and follow the prompts to enable Stroke Input Method in your system settings. There will be a default warning shown — this is normal.</p>
